    "In this project, it was developed a robust machine learning pipeline to predict house prices using various regression models. It was started by implementing extensive data cleaning and feature engineering steps. The core of the project involved hyperparameter optimization through GridSearchCV, where it was tested multiple models and configurations to identify the best-performing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gradient Boosting Regressor initially showed promising results, but further optimization revealed that the Extra Trees Regressor with specific hyperparameters provided the best performance, exceeding the business requirement of an R2 score of at least 0.75 on both the training and test sets. It was identified the most influential features and refit the model using these key predictors. Finally, the optimized model and relevant datasets were saved for future use.\n",

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of a systematic ML pipeline in solving realworld regression problems."
